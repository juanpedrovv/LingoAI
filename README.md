# LingoAI

## What is Lingo?
Lingo is an innovative audio translation tool I designed and developed. It distinguishes itself by preserving the prosodic features of the original audio or video, including naturalness, rhythm, pauses, and the voice of the speakers. 

## What can Lingo do at the moment?
Currently, Lingo can translate audio from any language into English while maintaining the authenticity of the input audio.

## Why is what is done, done? LingoAI Mission

Lingo is tailored for content creators who wish to increase their revenue by reaching audiences in other countries without language barriers.
Nevertheless, I believe that the technology Iâ€™ve developed can extend to many more sectors. My mission is to enable everyone to access educational audiovisual content by breaking the language barrier.
